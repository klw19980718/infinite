          <strong>Infinite Talk AI</strong> is an AI model focused on high‑fidelity <strong>Lip Sync</strong> and video generation. In the
          Image‑to‑Video workflow, it turns a single image into a natural talking or singing video, preserving identity while
          delivering precise mouth movements and expressive motion. The result is clean, convincing <strong>Lip Sync</strong> that feels
          authentic on top of your still image.
