          <strong>Infinite Talk AI</strong> is a production‑ready model for <strong>Lip Sync</strong> and video generation. In the
          Video‑to‑Video workflow, it edits existing footage by replacing lip movements and audio with new content while keeping
          the original look and timing. Its strongest advantage is the ultra‑clean <strong>Lip Sync</strong> replacement—after processing,
          the lips match the new speech or song so naturally that it feels like the source video was recorded that way.
