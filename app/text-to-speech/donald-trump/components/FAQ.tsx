              Is it legal to use a Donald Trump-style AI voice?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
              Laws differ by country and platform, but in general you should avoid using AI to pose as
              real people without consent, especially for political or commercial statements. Treat
              AI voices as fictional characters and clearly label them as synthetic.

              Does Infinite Talk AI provide an official Donald Trump voice?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
              No. Infinite Talk AI does not provide or endorse exact replicas of real individuals.
              You can, however, create original voices that feel presidential, authoritative, or
              comedic for commentary and satire.

              Can I use these voices on YouTube and social media?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm">
              In most cases yes, as long as you follow each platform&apos;s rules, our terms of use,
              and local law. Clearly mark AI voices as synthetic, avoid impersonation, and do not
              mislead viewers about what is real.
